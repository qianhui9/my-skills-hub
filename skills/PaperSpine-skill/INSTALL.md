# PaperSpine5 V5 installation

PaperSpine5 publishes separate self-contained suites for Windows x64, Linux
x86_64 with glibc, Apple Silicon Macs, and Intel Macs. Do not interchange
platform packages. Every suite includes its matching Python runtime, the Web
workspace, the canonical `paper-spine` Skill, and transactional profile
update/rollback.

## Which archive do I need?

Only the **platform suites** (26–56 MB) contain the V5 Web workspace and the
embedded runtime. Alpha.3 offers no separate Skill-only download. The historical
0.70 MB archive cannot repair a missing suite pointer or start a fresh task.

Installing the standalone archive on a host without that runtime produces this
as soon as the Skill tries to open the Web workspace:

```text
The standalone PaperSpine5 Web core is missing. Rebuild/install the current
self-contained paper-spine Skill; do not fall back to the terminal intake UI.
```

That message means the Skill is not bound to a verified full suite. Keep the
same profile and task data, then run the current platform installer to repair
the Skill pointer and verify startup.

Without the Web workspace the Skill can still do local work on an
already-configured task, but configuration, user choices, previews and
downloads all go through Web, so a fresh task cannot be started that way.

## Windows x64

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\install.ps1 -Target codex -CleanLegacy
```

Use `-Target claude-code` or `-Target both` as appropriate.

## macOS and Linux

```sh
sh ./install.sh --target codex --clean-legacy
```

Use `--target claude-code` or `--target both` as appropriate. The installer
auto-detects the OS and CPU, downloads only the matching suite, verifies its
exact byte count and SHA-256, verifies the suite internally, installs the Skill,
activates the profile, and requires first-start REST/MCP readiness.

To check without changing the installation:

```sh
sh ./install.sh --check-only
```

To verify a previously downloaded package without downloading it again:

```sh
sh ./install.sh --manifest /path/to/manifest.json --bundle /path/to/platform-suite.zip --target codex --clean-legacy
```

For a fully offline installation, **both installers need the manifest and the
matching suite ZIP**. Without a local manifest, `--bundle` or `-BundlePath` alone
still fetches the current manifest online. On Windows, supply both paths:

```powershell
.\install.ps1 -ManifestPath .\manifest.json -BundlePath .\paperspine5-suite-0.4.0-alpha.3.zip -Target codex -CleanLegacy
```

When applying a new version or repairing a missing Skill, the installers archive
the existing canonical `paper-spine` Skill if present. A complete current install
skips archive downloads and replacement. Cleanup of
known V3/V4 discovery names happens only when `-CleanLegacy` or
`--clean-legacy` is supplied. They do not delete paper task data, host settings,
or unknown folders. Restart the host after installation.

The default profile is `%USERPROFILE%\.paperspine5\profiles\default` on
Windows and `~/.paperspine5/profiles/default` on macOS/Linux. Each Skill invocation
checks the current platform channel and updates the suite and updater when needed,
unless explicitly disabled. Rerunning the platform installer checks the version, applies a transactional
update only when needed, and retains task data. Reload the host after an upgrade;
restart an already running workbench with the same profile to load the new code.

macOS packages in this prerelease are unsigned and not notarized. Linux support
is limited to glibc x86_64; Linux arm64 and musl/Alpine are not claimed.

## When the download itself fails

Some corporate networks, TLS-inspecting proxies and antivirus products cannot
reach `github.com` at all. The handshake then fails before any HTTP status
exists, so the error looks like a missing file:

```text
SEC_E_NO_CREDENTIALS
Could not create SSL/TLS secure channel
The underlying connection was closed: An error occurred on receive
```

These are local network/TLS conditions. The release assets are published and
downloadable from a healthy connection — confirm that from another machine
before concluding that a release is missing.

In order of effort:

1. Check whether something is intercepting TLS:

   ```powershell
   netsh winhttp show proxy
   ```

2. Fetch the manifest from the website mirror. It is a different host and is
   sometimes reachable when `github.com` is not:

   <https://wubing2023.github.io/PaperSpine/v5/downloads/manifest.json>

   It is a copy of the same manifest. The suite ZIPs are only published as
   GitHub Release assets, so the mirror alone cannot complete an install.

3. Install fully offline. Download `manifest.json` and the suite ZIP for this
   platform on a machine that can reach GitHub, copy both over, then run the
   command for your platform from the section above. The installer still checks
   the byte count and SHA-256 against the manifest, so a copied file is verified
   exactly like a downloaded one.
